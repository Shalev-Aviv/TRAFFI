# TRAFFIüö¶

## Overview
TRAFFI is a dynamic traffic light control simulation aimed at optimizing traffic flow by reducing car wait times at junctions. The project features a user-friendly interface where users can create and simulate different junctions. The system will intelligently adjust traffic light timings based on real-time conditions to improve efficiency. The backend will control Three.js objects to visualize the junction in 3D.

## Features‚ú®
- **React-based GUI:** An intuitive front-end interface for junction selection and traffic visualization.
- **Graph-based Traffic Control:** The system will use graph structures to model junctions and determine optimal traffic light patterns.
- **Dynamic Traffic Light Adjustments:** Prioritizes emergency vehicles and optimizes green light distribution.
- **Real-time Simulation:** Cars will be dynamically added and removed during the simulation.
- **Three.js Integration:** The junction visualization will be implemented using Three.js, controlled by the backend.
