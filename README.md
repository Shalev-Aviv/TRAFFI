# TRAFFIüö¶

## Overview
TRAFFI is a dynamic traffic light control simulation aimed at optimizing traffic flow by reducing car wait times at junctions. The project features a user-friendly interface where users can create and simulate different junctions. The system will intelligently adjust traffic light timings based on real-time conditions to improve efficiency. The backend will control Three.js objects to visualize the junction in 3D.

## Features‚ú®
- **React-based GUI**: An intuitive front-end interface for junction selection and traffic visualization.
- **Graph-based Traffic Control**: The system will use graph structures to model junctions and determine optimal traffic light patterns.
- **Dynamic Traffic Light Adjustments**: Prioritizes emergency vehicles and optimizes green light distribution.
- **Real-time Simulation**: Cars will be dynamically added and removed during the simulation.
- **Three.js Integration**: The junction visualization will be implemented using Three.js, controlled by the backend.

## Tech Stacküõ†Ô∏è
- **Frontend**: React 18 (Implemented), Three.js (Planned)
- **Backend**: Java 21 (In progress)
